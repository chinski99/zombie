## Zombie simulation

This is a zombie apocalypse simulation inspired by: http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/2013/04/the-dynamics-of-zombie-apocalypse.html

Changes to original model include:
* zombification ration - not all humans turn into zombies, lucky ones simply die
* Learning process - after each won encounter with a zombie, human can gain experience. The probability of experience gaining is inversely proportional to the current experience level

The simulation is implemented both as a standalone file and as a notebook. The comments are in Polish as I had to do it for a class in SGH (Warsaw University of Economics).
